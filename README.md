*Instead of navigating technical dashboards, users can simply ask — “Show me vessels near the Singapore Strait this week” — and watch the map update in real time.*

## Key Features

- Conversational Interface:
Chatbot-driven interaction enables users to task satellites, query data, and visualize insights effortlessly using natural language.

- Dynamic Map Visualization:
The map updates automatically based on user queries, offering a more engaging, human-centered experience.

- Custom Filters:
Users can define and track their Areas of Interest (AOIs), filter insights, and monitor activity relevant to their use case.

- Simplified Viewing:
Designed for users who value quick, intelligent, and accessible access to geospatial information without needing deep technical knowledge.

## Goal

To democratize access to satellite and geospatial insights by merging AI-driven chat with interactive mapping, creating a seamless bridge between human intent and geospatial intelligence.

## Tools & Technologies

- Lovable AI (for rapid prototyping)

- Interactive Map APIs (concept integration) using Leaflet

- Conversational AI Interface (concept design)
